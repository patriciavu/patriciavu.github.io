            Sororities heavily rely on online platforms as a way to showcase their chapter and members and to recruit potential new members (PNMs). The chapter’s website is the second most used online platform PNMs use, only topped by Instagram. Instagram can only express the sorority’s brand through imagery, but a chapter’s website allows for so much more. The website provides information about the specific sorority and content about what separates the chapter from other sororities. 
          <div class="head">Problem:</div>
            UCSD Tri Delta’s Vice President of Public Relations is unhappy with the chapter’s current website. The website uses the same template as the national website which leaves no room for personal branding for the UCSD chapter. The pictures are outdated and low quality, and the website is filled with text-heavy content taken from the national website. The only differentiation between the national website and UCSD’s is the pictures. As a result, users like PNMs are unable to identify UCSD Tri Delta’s brand.

      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;">INTERVIEWS</b></h5>

      Client Interview: <br>
      First, we interviewed our client Taylor, UCSD Tri Delta's Vice President of Public Relations, to get a better understanding of UCSD Tri Delta and what she invisioned for the website. Through this interview, we hoped to establish the chapter's brand and to figure out key features of the website. The key words we took from the interview are <b>friendship</b>, <b>genuine</b>, and <b>down-to-earth</b>, and our goal was to express these words throughout the website. 
      <br><br>
      After the client interview, my team and I analyzed and interpreted our notes to come up with design ideas for the website. Here are some of our ideas:
      <ul>
        <li>Use of bright/soft cheerful colors to create a inviting tone</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Use complementary colors for softness</li>
            <li>Use accent colors and a lot of white space</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Fun and captivating homepage that represents Tri Delta and their values at one glance</li>
        <li>Use small paragraphs instead of long ones to hold the attention of the user</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      User Interviews: <br>
      After our interview with Taylor, I conducted user interviews and used <b>non-leading</b> questions to allow for unbiased responses and insights. I interviewed 9 potential users in total which comprised of three sorority members, three students looking to join a sorority, and three parents of sorority members. The interviews I conducted gave my team and I useful insights on the needs of these three separate types of potential users. Using the information from the interviews, we were able to create three unique personas that embody what we believe are the three distinct types of users of the website. The three unique personas are the <b>Member</b>, the <b>Prospective</b>, and the <b>Parent</b>.

      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;">COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</b></h5>
      After the user research and our analysis of it, my team and I conducted a competitive analysis of competing sorority websites from UCSD and other schools to give us ideas for the website. We specifically chose websites that were responsive because we decided to create and design UCSD Tri Delta's website mobile first. We specifically analyzed the good design features to gives us more ideas on how to design

      <br><br>
      With the analyses finished, my team and I categorized the design features into categories: brand, functionality, content, site architecture, and design and wrote our takeaways from each category as well as design ideas. Here's a <a href="./documents/competitiveanalysis.pdf">link</a> to our competetive anaylysis with our takeaways. I found the competitive analysis to be very helpful because it showed what key features the website should have because they were present across all the websites we analyzed. I found it interesting that some of the websites had similar features even though they weren't best design choices. This made me realize that many of these sorority websites borrow features from other sorority websites because they're popular instead of thinking about the users. Taking this into account, I told my team that we shouldn't take aspects from these websites just because it was used often, but instead chose features that would make the website more user friendly.

      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;">CREATIVE BRIEF  &amp; WIREFRAME</b></h5>
      After conducting all the research and gathering all the data, we were finally able to craft our creative brief to present to our client Taylor. The creative brief outlined the scope, audience, objectives, personality and tone, key target audience insight, and anticipated problems. It served as a guidleline for both my team and our client to refer to as the project progressed. We would revisit the creative brief every week to make sure that our design decisions aligned with what was outlined, but we allowed ourselves to go against some of the guidleline if we found evidence from user testing.

      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;"> WIREFRAMES &amp; MOCKUPS</b></h5>
      With the creative brief finished, I created a paper wireframe of the mobile version of the website. This was the basis and skeleton for our mockups. Using the paper wireframe as a reference, I created the mobile version of the mockups on Figma. We decided to design the website mobile first, so the desktop mockup was created after by the rest of my team once the mobile version was finished.

    <section id="prototype" class="writing">
      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;">PROTOTYPES</b></h5>
      With ideation and analysis finsihed, my team and I went to work on coding the website. The biggest challenege we faced was that no one on our team was a developer, and all of us had moderate experience working with HTML and CSS. We initially decided to use a template we found online, but quickly scratched that idea and hard coded the website instead. 
      <figure style="text-align: center;" class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration="2s">
        <img src="./images/trideltaucsd/olddesign2.png" alt="Old Design" width="55%" height="auto">
        <figcaption>Fig 2. Old design of the website used too much color and too many fonts</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br>
      We had totally different website up until four days before the website was due for our class. The old design of the website relied too heavily on the use of a peach accent color and the fixed navigation bar took up too much real estate of the screen. In addition, too many different fonts were used which took away from the consistency of the website. After some quick user testing, I scraped the old design and rebranded and redesigned the website to how it is now. From the user testing, I found that the peach color used on the old design was too vibrant and distracting. In addition, the footer was too big and took up too much space. Taking this all into consideration, I chose a more minimalistic and clean approach to the redesign, using pink buttons and pink headings to bring an accent color to the website.

      <h5><b style="color:#DBCBFF;">TAKEAWAYS</b></h5>
      I am a member of Tri Delta UCSD, and so I had a different approach to this project compared to my teammates. My hardest decisions were making sure that the design choices weren’t influenced by my personal preferences. I had to juggle with putting aside my preferences, the client’s wants and needs, and the best design decisions. I had to learn to separate myself from the designer and the sorority member because as member, I have personal investment in how the website turned out.
